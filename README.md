## üî≠ About Me  
My name is Mohamed, and I am a third-year Data Science student at UC Berkeley who leverages logical programming to extract meaningful insights from data using appealing visualizations, statistical techniques, and machine learning. I love to create visualizations using several Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and more. 

Some of the statistical techniques I commonly use are:
- Correlation analysis
- T-test
- Chi-square
- ANOVA/MANOVA
- And many more.

I know how to set up proper experimentation setups and utilize A/B testing to validate results. My strong foundation in Mathematics allows me to fully grasp the process of machine learning with skills in Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Optimization, and Probability to ensure the best models with the correct assumptions.

I love to learn about data and stay updated by:
- Reading the latest research papers in machine learning
- Following Medium for up-to-date data techniques
- Keeping up with leaders in Artificial Intelligence.

## üåü Future Goals  
In the future, I see myself sharing my knowledge and helping others learn by:
- Creating full tutorials on projects related to Data Science and Data Engineering on my GitHub.
- Secure an internship to deepen my understanding and gain hands-on experience in this field, allowing me to further develop my skills and knowledge.

- Spam & Ham
    - This project focuses on creating a **spam/ham classifier** using **logistic regression** to distinguish between **spam (unwanted or promotional emails)** and **ham (regular emails)**. The dataset, sourced from **SpamAssassin**, contains over **8,000 labeled emails** for training and **1,000 unlabeled emails** for testing.
      - Key features extracted from the emails:
        - **HTML tags**: Presence of HTML formatting (common in spam emails).
        - **Font size formatting**: Usage of font adjustments to attract attention.
        - **URLs**: Count of links in emails.
        - **Punctuation**: Frequency of **exclamation marks** (`!`) and **question marks** (`?`).
        - **Subject length**: Length of email subject lines.
      - Visualized patterns in email text, including:
        - **Distribution of subject lengths** for spam vs. ham emails.
        - Proportions of spam/ham emails containing specific words and features.
      - **Algorithm**: Trained a **logistic regression model** using the engineered features.
      - **Performance**:
        - Achieved an **accuracy of ~87%** on the training dataset.
        - Balanced trade-offs between **precision**, **recall**, and **false positive rate**.
