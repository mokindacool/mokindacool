## ðŸ”­ About Me  
My name is [Your Name], and I am a [your profession, e.g., mathematician, data scientist, etc.] who utilizes logical programming to extract meaningful insights from data using appealing visualizations, statistical techniques, and machine learning. I love to create visualizations using several Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and more. I also utilize Power BI to make dashboard reports with essential KPIs and clean data using Power Query Editor.

Some of the statistical techniques I commonly use are:
- Correlation analysis
- T-test
- Chi-square
- ANOVA/MANOVA
- And many more.

I know how to set up proper experimentation setups and utilize A/B testing to validate results. My strong foundation in Mathematics allows me to fully grasp the process of machine learning with skills in Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Optimization, and Probability to ensure the best models with the correct assumptions.

I love to learn about data and stay updated by:
- Reading the latest research papers in machine learning
- Following Medium for up-to-date data techniques
- Keeping up with leaders in Artificial Intelligence.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Goals  
In the future, I see myself sharing my knowledge and helping others learn by:
- Creating full tutorials on projects related to Data Science and Data Engineering on my GitHub.
- Starting blogs on Medium and uploading more work to Kaggle.

I aim to inspire newcomers into the world of Data by taking a simplistic approach that motivates them to grow.
