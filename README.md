## üî≠ About Me  
My name is Mohamed, and I am a third-year Data Science student at UC Berkeley who leverages logical programming to extract meaningful insights from data using appealing visualizations, statistical techniques, and machine learning. I love to create visualizations using several Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and more. 

Some of the statistical techniques I commonly use are:
- Correlation analysis
- T-test
- Chi-square
- ANOVA/MANOVA
- And many more.

I know how to set up proper experimentation setups and utilize A/B testing to validate results. My strong foundation in Mathematics allows me to fully grasp the process of machine learning with skills in Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Optimization, and Probability to ensure the best models with the correct assumptions.

I love to learn about data and stay updated by:
- Reading the latest research papers in machine learning
- Following Medium for up-to-date data techniques
- Keeping up with leaders in Artificial Intelligence.

## üåü Future Goals  
In the future, I see myself sharing my knowledge and helping others learn by:
- Creating full tutorials on projects related to Data Science and Data Engineering on my GitHub.
- Secure an internship to deepen my understanding and gain hands-on experience in this field, allowing me to further develop my skills and knowledge.

- Spam & Ham
    - This project focuses on creating a **spam/ham classifier** using **logistic regression** to distinguish between **spam (unwanted or promotional emails)** and **ham (regular emails)**. The dataset, sourced from **SpamAssassin**, contains over **8,000 labeled emails** for training and **1,000 unlabeled emails** for testing.
      - Key features extracted from the emails:
        - **HTML tags**: Presence of HTML formatting (common in spam emails).
        - **Font size formatting**: Usage of font adjustments to attract attention.
        - **URLs**: Count of links in emails.
        - **Punctuation**: Frequency of **exclamation marks** (`!`) and **question marks** (`?`).
        - **Subject length**: Length of email subject lines.
      - Visualized patterns in email text, including:
        - **Distribution of subject lengths** for spam vs. ham emails.
        - Proportions of spam/ham emails containing specific words and features.
      - **Algorithm**: Trained a **logistic regression model** using the engineered features.
      - **Performance**:
        - Achieved an **accuracy of ~87%** on the training dataset.
        - Balanced trade-offs between **precision**, **recall**, and **false positive rate**.

- Predicting Housing Prices in Cook County
    - This project involves creating a predictive model to estimate housing prices in Cook County using a linear regression approach. The dataset includes property features and sale prices, with 204,792 entries for training/validation and 55,311 entries for testing.
        - Key Features Engineered
            - **Log-transformed Sale Price**: Normalized skewed housing price data.
            - **Land Area Features**: Square and log-transformed land square feet.
            - **Garage and Fireplaces**: Quantified garage sizes and number of fireplaces.
            - **Property Age**: Added a feature for property age and decade.
            - **Neighborhood and Location**: Incorporated town and neighborhood information.
        - Data Processing Pipeline
            1. **Outlier Removal**: Filtered sale prices using quartile-based thresholds.
            2. **Imputation**: Replaced missing values with the median for numerical features.
            3. **Log Transformations**: Applied to skewed features like building square feet and sale prices.
        - Visual Analysis
            - **Correlation Matrix**: Identified features with strong correlations to housing prices.
            - **Residual Plot**: Evaluated fairness and accuracy of the model, highlighting progressive behavior.
            - Utilized a **linear regression model** with a robust **data processing pipeline**.
            - **Training RMSE**: Achieved ~104,139 on the training dataset.
            - Balanced feature engineering to ensure accuracy and fairness in predictions.
        - Ethical Implications
            - Addressed **racial and economic disparities** in Cook County's property tax assessments.
            - Designed the model to minimize risks of **regressive taxation**.
            - Aimed to provide equitable assessments mindful of historical inequalities.
