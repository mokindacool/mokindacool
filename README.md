## üî≠ About Me  
My name is Mohamed, and I am a third-year Data Science student at UC Berkeley who leverages logical programming to extract meaningful insights from data using appealing visualizations, statistical techniques, and machine learning. I love to create visualizations using several Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and more. 

Some of the statistical techniques I commonly use are:
- Correlation analysis
- T-test
- Chi-square
- ANOVA/MANOVA
- And many more.

I know how to set up proper experimentation setups and utilize A/B testing to validate results. My strong foundation in Mathematics allows me to fully grasp the process of machine learning with skills in Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Optimization, and Probability to ensure the best models with the correct assumptions.

I love to learn about data and stay updated by:
- Reading the latest research papers in machine learning
- Following Medium for up-to-date data techniques
- Keeping up with leaders in Artificial Intelligence.

## üåü Future Goals  
In the future, I see myself sharing my knowledge and helping others learn by:
- Creating full tutorials on projects related to Data Science and Data Engineering on my GitHub.
- Secure an internship to deepen my understanding and gain hands-on experience in this field, allowing me to further develop my skills and knowledge.

- Spam & Ham
  -This project involved creating a spam/ham classifier using logistic regression to distinguish between spam (unwanted or promotional emails) and ham (regular emails). The dataset contained over 8,000 labeled emails, which were preprocessed and split into training and validation sets. Key steps included data cleaning, feature engineering (such as the presence of HTML tags, font size formatting, URLs, and punctuation like exclamation marks), and selecting features with higher relevance to spam classification. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed patterns like longer subject lengths and excessive formatting being associated with spam. After training the logistic regression model, we achieved an accuracy of approximately 87% on the training set.  The project also involved evaluating the model's performance through metrics like precision, recall, and false positive rates, and visualizing the trade-offs using an ROC curve. This approach allowed me to refine the model for improved spam detection accuracy.
